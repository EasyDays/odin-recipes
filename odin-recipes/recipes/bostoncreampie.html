   <p> Look at this <strong>Delicious!</strong><em>Boston Cream Pie</em></p>

   <p>This decadent Boston cream pie is a classic American Cake, not pie, made with tender vanilla sponge cake filled with silky vanilla pastry cream all topped by a glossy chocolate ganache.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>1 package (3.4 oz) instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
    <li>In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients.</li>
    <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    <li>Prepare the vanilla pudding according to package instructions. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the prepared pudding.</li>
    <li>Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread the pudding mixture over the top. Place the second cake layer on top.</li>
    <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the chocolate chips in 20-second intervals, stirring until smooth. Drizzle the melted chocolate over the cake.</li>
    <li>Refrigerate the Boston Cream Pie for a few hours before serving. Enjoy!</li>
